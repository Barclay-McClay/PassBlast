# PassBlast
 User inputs a string, waits 3 seconds, then the keyboard blasts out the string.

 Handy for getting past UAC windows that do not allow copy/paste.

## Requirements

The [App](App/) folder contains a packaged version of this app called `PassBlast.exe`

Just run the .exe!

There is also an older version of the app I made as an experiment with the `customtkinter` library. You can find that if you like in [Legacy](Legacy/)

## Source Code:

If you want to build the app from the [source code](Source/), you will need:
```
pip install pynput
```
and if you want to build the legacy version that used `customtkinter`:
```
pip install customtkinter
```
